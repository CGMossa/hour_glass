# hour_glass

This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) using Rust as a Backend for C++.

This is based upon the work of [Alex's Rust FFI Examples](https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust-ffi-examples/).

## How it works

* The rust library is included as a static library.
* The C++ facade lives inside the `rust::` namespace.
* A C++ `std::unique_ptr` manages the pointer to the Rust `IntSorter` ensuring it will never pass a nullpointer to the Rust functions. This prevents undefined behavior.

# Running your self

Run:

```
make clean all optimized
```

For a debug build run:
```
make clean all
```

## Requirements

* `make`
* `clang` or `clang++` or `gcc` or `g++` with c11 and c++11. You may mix the compilers, please run `make clean` when switching.
* `cargo` and `rustc` >= 1.11.0

## Expexted output:

```bash
$ make
mkdir -p target
clang -std=c11 -o target/main_c.o -c src/main.c
cargo build

Destroy IntSorter Instance
```

Note the reverse order of rusts "Destroy IntSorter Instance" message.
The reason is in C we explicitily destroy the `IntSorter` and in C++ the end of the scope destroys the object.
